# tgBot_Csh
Telegram bot as a project in the discipline "programming in C#"

This bot is developed as a final homework. Its functionality includes receiving .csv and .json files 
suitable for the correct format and performing such actions as sorting and selecting by object fields,
saving and sending the user the result in the form of .csv and .json file to choose from. 
It performs these actions using my class library "FileProcessing".

The bot also has a local logger that saves every user interaction on the local file in pc.
This bot was deployed and unloaded on a virtual machine, but now it is stopped. The maximum score was gained.
